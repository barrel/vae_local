require 'observer'

# == Synopsis
#
# A class for watching files within a directory and generating events when
# those files change.
#
# == Details
#
# A directory watcher is an +Observable+ object that sends events to
# registered observers when file changes are detected within the directory
# being watched.
#
# The directory watcher operates by scanning the directory at some interval
# and creating a list of the files it finds. File events are detected by
# comparing the current file list with the file list from the previous scan
# interval. Three types of events are supported -- *added*, *modified*, and
# *removed*.
#
# An added event is generated when the file appears in the current file
# list but not in the previous scan interval file list. A removed event is
# generated when the file appears in the previous scan interval file list
# but not in the current file list. A modified event is generated when the
# file appears in the current and the previous interval file list, but the
# file modification time or the file size differs between the two lists.
#
# The file events are collected into an array, and all registered observers
# receive all file events for each scan interval. It is up to the individual
# observers to filter the events they are interested in.
#
# === File Selection
#
# The directory watcher uses glob patterns to select the files to scan. The
# default glob pattern will select all regular files in the directory of
# interest '*'.
#
# Here are a few useful glob examples:
#
#     '*'               => all files in the current directory
#     '**/*'            => all files in all subdirectories
#     '**/*.rb'         => all ruby files
#     'ext/**/*.{h,c}'  => all C source code files
#
# *Note*: file events will never be generated for directories. Only regular
# files are included in the file scan.
#
# === Stable Files
#
# A fourth file event is supported but not enabled by default -- the
# *stable* event. This event is generated after a file has been added or
# modified and then remains unchanged for a certain number of scan
# intervals.
# 
# To enable the generation of this event the +stable+ count must be
# configured. This is the number of scan intervals a file must remain
# unchanged (based modification time and file size) before it is considered
# stable.
#
# To disable this event the +stable+ count should be set to +nil+.
#
# == Usage
#
# Learn by Doing -- here are a few different ways to configure and use a
# directory watcher.
#
# === Basic
#
# This basic recipe will watch all files in the current directory and
# generate the three default events. We'll register an observer that simply
# prints the events to standard out.
#
#    require 'directory_watcher'
#
#    dw = DirectoryWatcher.new '.'
#    dw.add_observer {|*args| args.each {|event| puts event}}
#
#    dw.start
#    gets      # when the user hits "enter" the script will terminate
#    dw.stop
#
# === Suppress Initial "added" Events
#
# This little twist will suppress the initial "added" events that are
# generated the first time the directory is scanned. This is done by
# pre-loading the watcher with files -- i.e. telling the watcher to scan for
# files before actually starting the scan loop.
#
#    require 'directory_watcher'
#
#    dw = DirectoryWatcher.new '.', :pre_load => true
#    dw.glob = '**/*.rb'
#    dw.add_observer {|*args| args.each {|event| puts event}}
#
#    dw.start
#    gets      # when the user hits "enter" the script will terminate
#    dw.stop
#
# There is one catch with this recipe. The glob pattern must be specified
# before the pre-load takes place. The glob pattern can be given as an
# option to the constructor:
#
#    dw = DirectoryWatcher.new '.', :glob => '**/*.rb', :pre_load => true
#
# The other option is to use the reset method:
#
#    dw = DirectoryWatcher.new '.'
#    dw.glob = '**/*.rb'
#    dw.reset true     # the +true+ flag causes the watcher to pre-load
#                      # the files
#
# === Generate "stable" Events
#
# In order to generate stable events, the stable count must be specified. In
# this example the interval is set to 5.0 seconds and the stable count is
# set to 2. Stable events will only be generated for files after they have
# remain unchanged for 10 seconds (5.0 * 2).
#
#    require 'directory_watcher'
#
#    dw = DirectoryWatcher.new '.', :glob => '**/*.rb'
#    dw.interval = 5.0
#    dw.stable = 2
#    dw.add_observer {|*args| args.each {|event| puts event}}
#
#    dw.start
#    gets      # when the user hits "enter" the script will terminate
#    dw.stop

class DirectoryWatcher

  VERSION = '1.1.2'    # :nodoc:

  # An +Event+ structure contains the _type_ of the event and the file _path_
  # to which the event pertains. The type can be one of the following:
  #
  #    :added      =>  file has been added to the directory
  #    :modified   =>  file has been modified (either mtime or size or both
  #                    have changed)
  #    :removed    =>  file has been removed from the directory
  #    :stable     =>  file has stabilized since being added or modified

  # Create a new +DirectoryWatcher+ that will generate events when file

  #    :interval  =>  30.0     the directory scan interval (in seconds)
